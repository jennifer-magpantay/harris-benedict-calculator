                <h3>What is the Daily Calorie calculator?</h3>
                <p>It is a mathematical equation for estimating the total calories
                    a person needs, known as Total
                    Energy Expenditure (TEE),
                    considering their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Physical Activities Level (PAL).</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?</h3>
                <p>It is the energy a person needs to carry out to
                    complete fundamental metabolic functions, such as brain function or breath, in a period of time,
                    without considering the energy that is spent on activities of the
                    day. It is calculated by using the Harris-Benedict equation.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>What is the Harris-Benedic Equation?</h3>
                <p>It is an equation that takes into consideration height, weight, age and gender to estimate an
                    individual's basal
                    metabolic rate.</p>
                <p>The result of this equation multiplied by the PAL factor is used to calculate TEE.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Physical Activities Level (PAL)?</h3>
                <p>PAL is a number multiplier used to estimate a person's TEE in combination with the BMR. It can be
                    also used to compute the amount of food energy a
                    person needs to consume in order to maintain a particular lifestyle.</p>
