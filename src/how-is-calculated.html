            <h3>How calories are calculated?</h3>
            <p>The estimate total calories a person needs, or as said before the Total Energy Expenditure (TEE), takes
                in consideration two parameters: the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Physical Activities Level (PAL) of
                an individual.</p>

            <h3>How BMR is Calculated Using the Harris-Benedict Equation?</h3>
            <p>According to Harris-Benedict equation, the estimates BMR rates values are based on height, weight, age,
                and gender of an
                individual. The resulting number represents about 60% to 75% of the daily kilocalorie intake to maintain
                current body
                weight, because it does not include the calories expended in activities and exercise.</p>

            <h3>Harris-Benedict Equation</h3>
            <p>The original Harris–Benedict equations was published in 1919. In 1984, a revision made by by Roza and
                Shizgal improved
                its accuracy.</p>

            <p>The equation adjusts the BMR to reflect activity levels by multiplying the values by one of a set of
                activity factors multipliers. The factors reflect the levels of activity throughout a one-week period as
                showed below:</p>
